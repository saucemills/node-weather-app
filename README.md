# Node Weather App
This was a project completed through following Andrew Mead's Node developer course. This app uses Node and Express.
The data is pulled using coordinates from the Mapbox API and weather data from the Weatherstack API.

Check out the app: https://jon-node-weather.herokuapp.com/

To use the app, enter either a city or zip code into the search bar and the app will display location and weather for what was input.
